# Industrial Gearbox Speed Reducer

## Overview
This project presents the **design and analysis of an industrial spur gear speed reducer** intended for continuous operation in an automated system.  
The gearbox is designed to reduce motor speed while increasing output torque, ensuring safe and reliable operation.

  ## Technical Specifications
- **Input power:** 7.5 HP  
- **Input speed:** 1440 rpm  
- **Transmission ratio:** i = 2.034 : 1  
- **Output speed:** ≈ 708 rpm  
- **Output torque:** 7.5 kgf·m  
- **Gear type:** Spur gears (straight teeth)  
- **Safety factor:** 3  
- **Lubrication:** Oil bath  
- **Expected service life:**  
  15 years – 300 working days/year – 16 h/day

## Design Scope
The project includes:
- Mechanical design of shafts, gears, housing, and auxiliary components  
- Strength and fatigue calculations for:
  - Gears
